Simply solve the mystery of Farpoint Station. \\r\\nPICARD: As simple as that. \\r\\nTROI: Farpoint Station. Even the name sounds mysterious. \\r\\nPICARD: It's hardly simple, Data, to negotiate a friendly agreement for\\r\\nStarfleet to use the base while at the same time snoop around finding\\r\\nhow and why the life form there built it. \\r\\nDATA: Inquiry. The word snoop? \\r\\nPICARD: Data, how can you be programmed as a virtual encyclopedia of\\r\\nhuman information without knowing a simple word like snoop? \\r\\nDATA: Possibility, a kind of human behaviour I was not designed to\\r\\nemulate. \\r\\nPICARD: It means to spy, to sneak. \\r\\nDATA: Ah! To seek covertly, to go stealthily, to slink, slither \\r\\nPICARD: Exactly, yes. \\r\\nDATA: Glide, creep, skulk, pussyfoot, gumshoe. \\r\\nTROI: Captain, I'm sensing a powerful mind. \\r\\n(Collision alert sounds)\\xa0\\r\\nTORRES: Something strange on the detector circuits. \\r\\n(A massive barrier appears in front of them in space) \\r\\nDATA: It registers as solid, Captain. \\r\\nTROI: Or an incredibly powerful forcefield. But if we collide with\\r\\neither it could be very \\r\\nPICARD: Shut off that damned noise. Go to Yellow Alert. \\r\\nWORF: Shields and deflectors up, sir. \\r\\n(The barrier ripples like chain mail) \\r\\nPICARD: Reverse power, full stop. \\r\\nTORRES: Controls to full stop, sir. Now reading full stop, sir. \\r\\n(There's a flash of light, and an Elizabethan era soldier appears,\\r\\ncomplete with breast plate and plumed hat) \\r\\nQ: Thou are notified that thy kind hath infiltrated the galaxy too far\\r\\nalready. Thou art directed to return to thine own solar system\\r\\nimmediately. \\r\\nPICARD: That's quite a directive. Would you mind identifying what you\\r\\nare? \\r\\nQ: We call ourselves the Q. Or thou mayst call me that. It's all much\\r\\nthe same thing. \\r\\n(The same force barrier stops two people exiting the turbolift) \\r\\nQ: I present myself to thee as a fellow ship captain, that thou mayst\\r\\nbetter understand me. Go back whence thou camest. (to Helmsman) Stay\\r\\nwhere thou art! \\r\\n(And the helmsman is frozen solid, phaser in hand) \\r\\nPICARD: Data, call medics. \\r\\nTROI: He's frozen. \\r\\nPICARD: He would not have injured you. Do you recognise this, the stun\\r\\nsetting? \\r\\nQ: Knowing humans as thou dost, Captain, wouldst thou be captured\\r\\nhelpless by them? Now, go back or thou shalt most certainly die. \\nCaptain's log, supplementary. The frozen form of\\r\\nLieutenant Torres has been rushed to sickbay. The question now is the\\r\\nincredible power of the Q being. Do we dare oppose it? \\n[Bridge]\\n\\nQ: Captain, thy little centuries go by so rapidly.\\r\\nPerhaps thou will better understand this. \\r\\n(A flash of light and he is wearing a 20th century US military uniform,\\r\\nwith a cigarette in his hand) \\r\\nQ: Actually, the issue at stake is patriotism. You must return to your\\r\\nworld and put an end to the commies. All it takes is a few good men. \\r\\nPICARD: What? That nonsense is centuries behind us. \\r\\nQ: But you can't deny that you're still a dangerous, savage child race.\\r\\n\\r\\nPICARD: Most certainly I deny it. I agree we still were when humans\\r\\nwore costumes like that, four hundred years ago. \\r\\nQ: At which time you slaughtered millions in silly arguments about how\\r\\nto divide the resources of\\r\\nyour little world. And four hundred years before that you were\\r\\nmurdering each other in quarrels over tribal god-images. Since there\\r\\nare no indications that humans will ever change. \\r\\nPICARD: But even when we wore costumes like that we'd already started\\r\\nto make rapid progress. \\r\\nQ: Oh yeah? You want to review your rapid progress? \\r\\n(Flash, and a change into a padded suit) \\r\\nQ: Rapid progress, to where humans learned to control their military\\r\\nwith drugs. \\r\\nWORF: Sir, sickbay reports Lieutenant Torres's condition is better. \\r\\nQ: Oh, concern for one's fellow comrade. How touching. \\r\\nWORF: And now a personal request, sir. Permission to clean up the\\r\\nbridge. \\r\\nTASHA: Lieutenant Worf is right, sir. As Security Chief I can't just\\r\\nstand here and let\\r\\nPICARD: Yes you can, Lieutenant Yar. \\r\\nQ: (taking a snort of something) Oh, better. And later, on finally\\r\\nreaching deep space, humans of course found enemies to fight out there\\r\\ntoo. And to broaden those struggles you again found allies for still\\r\\nmore murdering. The same old story, all over again. \\r\\nPICARD: No. The same old story is the one we're meeting now.\\r\\nSelf-righteous life forms who are eager not to learn but to prosecute,\\r\\nto judge anything they don't understand or can't tolerate. \\r\\nQ: What an interesting idea. Prosecute and judge. Suppose it turns out\\r\\nwe understand you humans only too well. \\r\\nPICARD: We've no fear of what the true facts about us will reveal. \\r\\nQ: Facts about you? Splendid, splendid, Captain! You're a veritable\\r\\nfountain of good ideas. There are preparations to make, but when we\\r\\nnext meet, Captain, we'll proceed exactly as you suggest. \\r\\n(A flash and he is gone) \\r\\nWORF: Sir, respectfully submit our only choice is to fight. \\r\\nTASHA: Fight, or try to escape. \\r\\nPICARD: Sense anything, Commander? \\r\\nTROI: Its mind is much too powerful. Recommend we avoid contact. \\r\\nPICARD: From this point, no station aboard, repeat no station, for any\\r\\nreason will make use of transmitted signals or intercom. We'll try and\\r\\ntake them by surprise. Let's see what this galaxy class starship can\\r\\ndo. (to Worf) Lieutenant, inform engine room to prepare for maximum\\r\\nacceleration. \\r\\nWORF: Aye, sir. \\r\\nPICARD: Records search, Data. Results of detaching saucer section at\\r\\nhigh warp velocity. \\r\\nDATA: Inadvisable at any warp speed, sir. \\r\\nPICARD: Search theoretical. \\r\\nDATA: It is possible, sir. But absolutely no margin for error. \\r\\nPICARD: Using print-out only, notify all decks to prepare for maximum\\r\\nacceleration. Now hear this, Maximum, you're entitled to know, means\\r\\nthat we'll be pushing our engines well beyond safety limits. Our hope\\r\\nis to surprise whatever that is out there, try and outrun it. Our only\\r\\nother option is to tuck tail between our legs and return to Earth as\\r\\nthey demand. \\r\\n(Worf makes his trip to Engineering and back) \\r\\nWORF: Engine room ready, sir. \\r\\nTROI: The board shows green, Captain. All go. \\r\\nPICARD: Stand by. Engage. \\r\\n(They swoop along and past the barrier, which then turns into a ball\\r\\nand chases them) \\r\\nWORF: Velocity warp nine point two. \\r\\nDATA: Heading three five one mark eleven, sir. \\r\\nPICARD: Steady on that. \\r\\nTASHA: The hostile is now giving chase, sir. Accelerating fast. \\r\\nWORF: We're now at warp nine point three, sir, which takes us past the\\r\\nred line, sir. \\r\\nPICARD: Continue accelerating. Counsellor, at this point I'm open to\\r\\nguesses about what we've just met. \\r\\nTROI: It it felt like something beyond what we'd consider a life form. \\r\\nPICARD: Beyond? \\r\\nTROI: Very, very advanced, sir, or certainly very, very different. \\r\\nWORF: We're at nine point four, sir. \\r\\nTASHA: Hostile is now beginning to overtake us, sir. \\r\\nPICARD: Are you sure? \\r\\nDATA: Hostile's velocity is already warp nine point six, sir. Shall I\\r\\nput them on the main viewer? \\r\\nPICARD: Reverse angle. \\r\\nDATA: Magnifying viewer image. \\r\\nTASHA: Hostile's velocity is nine point seven, sir. \\r\\nPICARD: Worf, inform the engine room we need more. \\r\\nDATA: Engine room attempting to comply, sir, but they caution us \\r\\nPICARD: Go to yellow alert. Arm aft photon torpedoes. Place them on\\r\\nready status. \\r\\nTASHA: Torpedoes to ready, sir. \\r\\nTASHA: Hostile now at warp nine point eight, sir. \\r\\nWORF: Our velocity is only nine point five, sir. \\r\\nDATA: Projection, sir. We may be able to match hostile's nine point\\r\\neight, sir. But at extreme risk. \\r\\nTASHA: Now reading the hostile at warp nine point nine, sir. \\r\\nPICARD: Now hear this. Print-out message, urgent, all stations on all\\r\\ndecks. Prepare for emergency saucer sever. You will command the saucer\\r\\nsection, Lieutenant. \\r\\nWORF: I am a Klingon, sir. For me to seek escape when my Captain goes\\r\\ninto battle. \\r\\nPICARD: You are a Starfleet officer, Lieutenant. \\r\\nWORF: Aye, sir. \\r\\nPICARD: Make the mark, Data. Note in ship's log that at this startime,\\r\\nI'm transferring command to the battle bridge. \\r\\n(Picard, Data, Yar and Troi leave the Bridge to unnamed crew)\\r\\n\\nCaptain's log, stardate 41153.7. Preparing to\\r\\ndetach saucer section. so that families and the majority of the ship's\\r\\ncompany can seek relative safety while the vessel's stardrive,\\r\\ncontaining the battle bridge and main armaments, will turn\\r\\nback and confront the mystery that is threatening us.\\r\\n\\n[Battle Bridge]\\n\\n(Families of various races make their way along\\r\\ncorridors as the bridge crew settle into a more compact Bridge) \\r\\nPICARD: Lieutenant, your torpedoes must detonate close enough to the\\r\\nhostile to blind it at the moment we separate. \\r\\nTASHA: Understood, sir. \\r\\nTROI: All decks acknowledging, sir. \\r\\nPICARD: Worf, this is the Captain. \\n[Bridge]\\n\\nPICARD [OC]: At the moment of separation, we will\\r\\nreverse power just enough to get your saucer section out ahead and\\r\\nclear of us. \\r\\nWORF: Understood, Captain. \\n[Battle Bridge]\\n\\nTASHA: Torpedoes away, sir. \\r\\n(Eight red dots shoot out from the stern) \\r\\nPICARD: Begin countdown. Mark. \\r\\nDATA: Starship separation in six, five, four, three, two, one. \\r\\n(Gracefully, the huge saucer lifts away from the body of the ship) \\r\\nDATA: Separation is successful, sir. \\r\\n(The main body does a hand-brake turn and heads back to their pursuer.\\r\\nThe torpedoes detonate.) \\r\\nTASHA: Torpedoes have detonated, sir. \\r\\nPICARD: Let's come to a stop. Reverse power. \\r\\nDATA: Reverse power. Decelerating. \\r\\nPICARD: Dead stop. We'll hold this position and wait for them. \\r\\nTROI: That will bring them here in just minutes, sir. \\r\\nTASHA: Will we make a fight of it, Captain? If we can at least damage\\r\\ntheir ship we'll have a chance \\r\\nPICARD: Lieutenant, are you recommending we fight a life form that can\\r\\ndo all those things? I'd like to hear your advice. \\r\\nTASHA: I spoke before I thought, sir. We should look for some way to\\r\\ndistract them from going after the saucer. \\r\\nO'BRIEN: All forward motion stopped, sir. \\r\\nPICARD: Thank you, conn. Commander, signal the following in all\\r\\nlanguages and on all frequencies. We surrender. State that we are not\\r\\nasking for any terms or conditions. \\r\\nTROI: Aye, sir. All language forms and frequencies. \\r\\n(The ball reaches them and surrounds them with it's barrier. The ship\\r\\nshakes) \\n[Courtroom]\\n\\n(The crew find themselves in a room with a noisy\\r\\naudience. One of the future soldiers that Q pretended to be, fires his\\r\\nmachine gun for silence. An Oriental man takes charge) \\r\\nBAILIFF: The prisoners will all stand. \\r\\n(Picard sits down) \\r\\nDATA: Historically intriguing, Captain. Very, very accurate. \\r\\nPICARD: Mid twenty first century. The post-atomic horror. \\r\\nBAILIFF: All present, stand and make respectful attention to honoured\\r\\nJudge. \\r\\nTROI: Careful, sir. This is not an illusion or a dream. \\r\\nPICARD: But these courts happened in the past. \\r\\nTROI: I don't understand either, but this is real. \\r\\nSOLDIER: Get to your feet, criminals! \\r\\n(From the distance, a spotlight reveals a figure approaching, dressed\\r\\nin red, and sitting on a throne carried on hydraulics for effect) \\r\\nDATA: At least we are acquainted with the judge, Captain. \\r\\n(Q gestures the crowd to sit) \\r\\nSOLDIER: Attention! On your feet. Attention! \\r\\n(Tasha disarms him) \\r\\nQ: (to soldier) You are out of order. (another soldier kills him) The\\r\\nprisoners will not be harmed until they are found guilty. Dispose of\\r\\nthat. \\r\\nPICARD: Can we assume you mean this will be a fair trial? \\r\\nQ: Yes, absolutely equitable. Proceed. \\r\\nBAILIFF: Before this gracious court now appear these prisoners to\\r\\nanswer for the multiple and grievous savageries of their species. How\\r\\nplead you, criminal? \\r\\nDATA: If I may, Captain? Objection, your honour. In the year 2036, the\\r\\nnew United Nations declared that no Earth citizen\\r\\ncould be made to answer for the crimes of his race or forbears. \\r\\nQ (JUDGE): Objection denied. This is a court of the year 2079, by which\\r\\ntime more rapid progress had caused all United\\r\\nEarth nonsense to be abolished. \\r\\nPICARD: Tasha, no. \\r\\nTASHA: I must! Because I grew up on a world that allowed things like\\r\\nthis court. And it was people like these that saved me from it. This\\r\\nso-called court should get down on its knees to what Starfleet is, what\\r\\nit represents. \\r\\n(Q freezes Tasha) \\r\\nTROI: You barbarian! This woman \\r\\nBAILIFF: Criminals keep silence! \\r\\nPICARD: You've got a lot to learn about humans if you think you can\\r\\ntorture us or frighten us into silence. Will she live? \\r\\nDATA: Uncertain. When he froze Lieutenant Torres on the Bridge, we had\\r\\nour Sickbay to help thaw him out. \\r\\nBAILIFF: You will answer the charges, criminals. \\r\\nPICARD: Or what? Or this? Her death? Or worse? You promised the\\r\\nprisoners will not be harmed. We plead nothing so long as you break\\r\\nyour own rules. \\r\\nQ: I suggest you centre your attention on this trial, Captain. It may\\r\\nbe your only hope. \\r\\nPICARD: I suggest you are now having second thoughts it. You are\\r\\nconsidering that if you conduct a fair trial, which was your promise,\\r\\nyou may lose. \\r\\nQ: Lose? \\r\\nPICARD: Yes, even though you're judge and prosecutor. \\r\\nQ: And jury. \\r\\nPICARD: Accepted, so long as you keep to your agreement. And assaulting\\r\\nprisoners is hardly a fair trial. \\r\\nQ: This is a merciful court. (Tasha is thawed) Silence! Continuing\\r\\nthese proceedings, I must caution you that legal trickery is not\\r\\npermitted. This is a court of \\r\\nPICARD: court of fact! We humans know our past, even when we're ashamed\\r\\nof it. I recognise this court system as the one that agreed with that\\r\\nline from Shakespeare.  Kill all the\\r\\nlawyers. \\r\\nQ: Which was done. \\r\\nPICARD: Which led to the rule guilty until proven innocent. \\r\\nQ: Of course. Bringing the innocent to trial would be unfair. You will\\r\\nnow answer to the charge of being a grievously savage race. \\r\\nPICARD: Grievously savage could mean anything. I will answer only\\r\\nspecific charges. \\r\\nQ: Are you certain you want a full disclosure of human ugliness? So be\\r\\nit, fool! Present the charges. \\r\\nBAILIFF: Criminal, you will read the charges to the court. \\r\\n(Picard takes his time to read the pad that is handed to him, then\\r\\ngives it back) \\r\\nPICARD: I see no charges against us, Your Honour. \\r\\nQ: You are out of order! \\r\\n(Guns are placed at Data and Troi's heads) \\r\\nQ: Soldiers, you will press those triggers if this criminal answers\\r\\nwith any word other than guilty. Criminal, how plead you? \\r\\nPICARD: Guilty. Provisionally. \\r\\nQ: The Court will hear the provision. \\r\\nPICARD: We question whether this court is abiding by its own trial\\r\\ninstructions. Have I have permission to have Commander Data repeat the\\r\\nrecord? \\r\\nQ: There will be no legal trickery \\r\\nPICARD: These will be your own words, your Honour. What exactly what\\r\\nfollowed his Honour's statement that the prisoner will not be harmed? \\r\\nDATA: Yes, sir. The Captain had asked the question. Can we assume you\\r\\nmean this will be a fair trial? And in reply the judge stated, yes,\\r\\nabsolutely equitable. \\r\\nQ: Irrelevant testimony, entirely irrelevant. \\r\\nPICARD: Alright! We agree there is evidence to support the court's\\r\\ncontention that humans have been savage. Therefore I say test us. Test\\r\\nwhether this is presently true of humans. \\r\\nQ: I see, I see. And so you petition the Court to accept you and your\\r\\ncomrades as proof of what humanity has become. \\r\\nPICARD: There must be many ways we can be tested. We have a long\\r\\nmission ahead of us. \\r\\nQ: Another brilliant suggestion, Captain. But your test hardly requires\\r\\na long mission. Your immediate destination offers far more challenge\\r\\nthan you can possibly imagine. Yes, this Farpoint station will be an\\r\\nexcellent test. \\r\\nBAILIFF: All present, respectfully stand. \\r\\nQ: This trial is adjourned, to allow the criminals to be tested. \\r\\nBAILIFF: This honourable court is adjourned. Stand respectfully. \\r\\nQ: Captain, you may find you are not nearly clever enough to deal with\\r\\nwhat lies ahead for you. It may have been better to accept sentence\\r\\nhere.\\r\\n\\n[Battle Bridge]\\n\\n(O'Brien is unaware the four were ever away) \\r\\nDATA: What is present course, conn? \\r\\nO'BRIEN: It's what it's been all along, sir. Direct heading to Farpoint\\r\\nStation. \\r\\nDATA: Confirm. We are on that heading, sir. \\r\\nO'BRIEN: Know anything about Farpoint Station, sir? Sounds like a\\r\\nfairly dull place. \\r\\nPICARD: We've heard that we may find it rather interesting. \\nPersonal log, Commander William Riker. Stardate\\r\\n41153.7. The USS Hood has dropped me off at Farpoint Station, where I\\r\\nawait the arrival of the new USS Enterprise to which I have been\\r\\nassigned as First Officer. Meanwhile I have been asked to visit the\\r\\nFarpoint Administrator's Office, in the old city.\\r\\n\\n[Zorn's office]\\n\\n(It is a standard wooden room, a desk with a bowl\\r\\nof fruit on it. Zorn is humanoid in loose clothing with long straight\\r\\nhair) \\r\\nZORN: Ah, Commander Riker, I thought you'd want to know we've still no\\r\\nword from your vessel. I trust we made your waiting comfortable? \\r\\nRIKER: Luxurious is more like it. \\r\\nZORN: Good. (gets muddled over a handshake) Good. \\r\\nRIKER: Would I seem ungrateful if I ask for some information? \\r\\nZORN: Anything. \\r\\nRIKER: Fascinating, the advanced materials used in constructing this\\r\\nspace station. Your energy supply must be as abundant as I've heard. \\r\\nZORN: Geothermal energy is the one great blessing of this planet. I'll\\r\\nhave all the details of that sent to your quarters. \\r\\nRIKER: Thank you. But it still seems incredible to me that you could\\r\\nhave constructed this station so rapidly and so, so perfectly suited to\\r\\nour needs. \\r\\nZORN: Would your care for an Earth delicacy, Commander? \\r\\nRIKER: (looking at the bowl of fruit) If there's an apple? \\r\\nZORN: I'm sorry, Commander. \\r\\nRIKER: It doesn't matter. What I was saying was (suddenly there is a\\r\\nsecond bowl of apples) I'll be damned. \\r\\nZORN: Ah yes, there was another selection here \\r\\nRIKER: Groppler, I could have sworn it wasn't here a minute ago. \\r\\nZORN: And did your failure to notice it make it unwelcome? \\r\\nRIKER: Not at all, Groppler. \\r\\nZORN: I trust it will be the same with Farpoint Station, Commander. A\\r\\nfew easily answered questions about it won't make Starfleet appreciate\\r\\nit less. \\r\\nRIKER: And it's delicious. Thank you. Good morning, Groppler Zorn. \\r\\nZORN: Good morning. \\r\\n(Riker leaves with his apple) \\r\\nZORN: (to the air) You have been told not to do that. Why can't you\\r\\nunderstand? It will arouse their suspicion. And if that happens, we\\r\\nwill have to punish you. We will, I promise you.\\r\\n\\n[Market place]\\n\\nRIKER: Doctor Crusher! \\r\\nWESLEY: Mother, it's Commander Riker. \\r\\nRIKER: Hello, Wes. Enjoying Farpoint Station? \\r\\nWESLEY: Yes, sir. \\r\\nRIKER: I saw you. I thought I might join you for a stroll. \\r\\nCRUSHER: Actually, we were about to do some shopping. \\r\\nRIKER: I've been meaning to visit the mall myself. \\r\\nCRUSHER: Of course. \\r\\nWESLEY: If you're wondering about Mom, Commander Riker, she's not\\r\\nunfriendly. She's just shy around men she doesn't know. \\r\\nCRUSHER: Wesley! I believe that means he would like us to be friends. \\r\\nRIKER: I'm willing, Doctor. Although we're not officially part of the\\r\\nEnterprise, I thought there might be something useful we can do while\\r\\nwe wait. \\r\\nCRUSHER: Useful? How, Commander? \\r\\nRIKER: Investigating some things that I've noticed since I've been\\r\\nhere. The last was a piece of fruit. \\r\\nCRUSHER: (examining a bolt of cloth) Gold would be lovely with this. I\\r\\nam sure, Commander, there are reasons for a first officer to want to\\r\\ndemonstrate his energy and alertness to a new captain. But since my\\r\\nduty and interests are outside the command\\r\\nstructure \\r\\n(Suddenly the bolt of cloth has a gold pattern on it) \\r\\nRIKER: Isn't it remarkable they happen to have exactly what you asked\\r\\nfor? \\r\\nCRUSHER: Thank you. I'll take the entire bolt. Send it to our starship\\r\\nwhen it arrives. Charge to Doctor Crusher. \\r\\n(they walk away from the stall) \\r\\nRIKER: Let's see, where were we? \\r\\nCRUSHER: I was accusing you of inventing work in order to curry favour\\r\\nwith our new captain. I apologise. \\r\\nWESLEY: Mom, that gold pattern wasn't there. \\r\\nCRUSHER: Maybe this is something Jean-Luc would like looked into. \\r\\nRIKER: Jean-Luc Picard? You know the Captain? \\r\\nWESLEY: When I was little, he brought my father's body home to us. \\r\\nCRUSHER: Yes, Wes, long, long ago. A pleasure to meet you, Commander.\\r\\nYou will excuse us. \\r\\nRIKER: My pleasure, Doctor. Wes. \\r\\nWESLEY: Sir? \\r\\nRIKER: See you on board. \\r\\nWESLEY: Yes, sir. \\r\\n(Crusher and Wesley leave Riker, and another uniformed man arrives,\\r\\nwearing a device across his eyes) \\r\\nLAFORGE: Sir, the Enterprise is arriving \\r\\nRIKER: Is this an official report, Lieutenant? \\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\nLAFORGE: Sorry, Commander. Sir, Lieutenant La Forge reporting. The\\r\\nEnterprise arriving, but without the saucer section, sir. \\r\\nRIKER: Stardrive section only? What happened? \\r\\nLAFORGE: I don't know, sir. Captain Picard has signalled for you to\\r\\nbeam up immediately. \\r\\nRIKER: Our new captain doesn't waste time. It's a good idea. Thank you,\\r\\nLieutenant. \\r\\nLAFORGE: Aye, sir. \\r\\nRIKER: (moves into a clear space) Enterprise, this is Commander Riker\\r\\nat Farpoint Station. Standing by\\r\\nto beam up. \\n[Transporter room]\\n\\n(Riker materialises) \\r\\nTASHA: Lieutenant Yar of Security, sir. Captain Picard will see you on\\r\\nthe Battle Bridge. \\n[Corridor]\\n\\nRIKER: With the saucer gone, I assume something\\r\\ninteresting happened on your way here? \\n[Turbolift]\\n\\nTASHA: Battle bridge. That's for the Captain to\\r\\nexplain, sir.\\r\\n\\n[Battle bridge]\\n\\nPICARD: Do we have clearance? \\r\\nDATA: Aye, sir, into the standard parking orbit. \\r\\nPICARD: Make it so. \\r\\nTASHA: Commander Riker, sir. \\r\\nRIKER: Riker, WT, reporting as ordered, sir. \\r\\nPICARD: Is the viewer ready? \\r\\nTASHA: All set up, sir. \\r\\nPICARD: We'll first bring you up to date on a little adventure we had\\r\\non our way here, Commander. Then we'll talk. Welcome aboard. \\r\\nTASHA: (to Riker) This way, sir. \\r\\n(She sits him down in front of a screen and runs a tape of the Q\\r\\nencounter on the Bridge) \\r\\nQ [on monitor]: Thou art directed to return to thine own solar system\\r\\nimmediately. Go back or thou shalt most certainly die. You can't deny\\r\\nyou're still a dangerous, savage, child race. \\r\\nDATA: Message from the saucer module, sir. It will arrive here in fifty\\r\\none minutes. \\r\\nPICARD: Inform them we'll connect as soon as they arrive. And sent the\\r\\nCommander to me when he's finished. \\r\\nTASHA: Yes, sir. \\r\\n(Picard leaves) \\r\\nQ [on monitor]: And four hundred years before that, you were murdering\\r\\neach other in quarrels over tribal god images. Since then there are no\\r\\nindications that humans will ever change. There are preparations to\\r\\nmake, and when we next meet, Captain, we'll proceed exactly as you\\r\\nsuggest. \\r\\nRIKER: He calls that a little adventure? \\n[Battle ready room]\\n\\nPICARD: Come. \\r\\nRIKER: Not exactly a run of the mill happening, Captain. \\r\\nPICARD: It seems we're alive only because we have been placed on\\r\\nprobation. A very serious kind of probation. (answers\\r\\ncomm.) Go. \\r\\nDATA [OC]: The saucer module is now entering orbit with us, sir. \\r\\nPICARD: Acknowledged. Commander Riker will conduct a manual docking.\\r\\nPicard out. \\r\\nRIKER: Sir? \\r\\nPICARD: You've reported in, haven't you? You are qualified? \\r\\nRIKER: Yes, sir. \\r\\nPICARD: Then I mean now, Commander. \\n[Battle bridge]\\n\\nDATA: They say you will be doing this manually,\\r\\nsir. No automation. \\r\\nRIKER: As ordered. \\r\\n(They approach the saucer from astern, of course) \\r\\nRIKER: Velocity to one half metre per second. Adjust pitch angle,\\r\\nnegative three degrees. Watch your roll angle, conn. All stations,\\r\\nprepare for reconnection. Thrusters to station keeping. All velocity\\r\\nzero. Her inertia should do the job now. Lock up now. \\r\\n(The clamps rise and the two parts of the ship meet again) \\n[Ready room]\\n\\nPICARD: A fairly routine manoeuvre but you handled\\r\\nit quite well. \\r\\nRIKER: Thank you, sir. I hope I showed some promise. \\r\\nPICARD: I do have some questions for you though.\\xa0\\r\\nRIKER: Yes, sir, I thought you might. \\r\\nPICARD: I see in your file that Captain DeSoto thinks very highly of\\r\\nyou. One curious thing, however, you refused to let him beam down to\\r\\nAltair Three. \\r\\nRIKER: In my opinion, sir, Altair Three was too dangerous to risk\\r\\nexposing the Captain. \\r\\nPICARD: I see. A Captain's rank means nothing to you. \\r\\nRIKER: Rather the reverse, sir. But a Captain's life means a great deal\\r\\nto me. \\r\\nPICARD: Isn't it just possible that you don't get to be a Starfleet\\r\\nCaptain without knowing whether it's safe to beam down or not? Isn't it\\r\\na little presumptuous of a first officer to second guess his captain's\\r\\njudgment? \\r\\nRIKER: Permission to speak candidly, sir? \\r\\nPICARD: Always. \\r\\nRIKER: Having been a first officer yourself, you know that assuming\\r\\nthat responsibility must by definition include the safety of the\\r\\ncaptain. I have no problem with following any rules you lay down, short\\r\\nof compromising your safety. \\r\\nPICARD: And you don't intend to back off that position? \\r\\nRIKER: No, sir, \\r\\nPICARD: One further thing. A special favour. \\r\\nRIKER: Anything, sir. \\r\\nPICARD: Using the same kind of strength you showed with Captain DeSoto,\\r\\nI would appreciate it if you can keep me from making an ass of myself\\r\\nwith children. \\r\\nRIKER: Sir? \\r\\nPICARD: I'm not a family man, Riker, and yet, Starfleet has given me a\\r\\nship with children aboard. \\r\\nRIKER: Yes, sir. \\r\\nPICARD: And I don't feel comfortable with children. But, since a\\r\\ncaptain needs an image of geniality, you're to see that's what I\\r\\nproject. \\r\\nRIKER: Aye, sir. \\r\\nPICARD: Welcome to the Enterprise, Commander Riker. \\n[Sickbay]\\n\\nCRUSHER: Naturally I've heard of your case. The\\r\\nvisor implants you wear \\r\\nLAFORGE: Is a remarkable piece of bio-electronic engineering by which I\\r\\nquote see much of the EM spectrum ranging from simple heat and infrared\\r\\nthrough radio waves et cetera, et cetera, and forgive me if I've said\\r\\nand listened to this a thousand times before. \\r\\n(Without the Visor, Geordi La Forge's eyes are white sightless orbs,\\r\\nand he has flashing red lights at his temples) \\r\\nCRUSHER: You've been blind all your life? \\r\\nLAFORGE: I was born this way. \\r\\nCRUSHER: And you've felt pain all the years that you've used this? \\r\\nLAFORGE: They say it's because I use my natural sensors in different\\r\\nways. \\r\\nCRUSHER: Well, I see two choices. The first is painkillers. \\r\\nLAFORGE: Which would affect how this works. No. Choice number two? \\r\\nCRUSHER: Exploratory surgery. Desensitise the brain areas troubling\\r\\nyou. \\r\\nLAFORGE: Same difference. No, thank you, Doctor. \\r\\nCRUSHER: I understand. \\r\\nLAFORGE: See you. \\n[Bridge]\\n\\n(Riker enters) \\r\\nWORF: Yes sir? \\r\\nRIKER: Where will I find Commander Data? \\r\\nWORF: Commander Data is on special assignment, sir. He's using our\\r\\nshuttlecraft to transfer an admiral over to the Hood. \\r\\nRIKER: An admiral? \\r\\nWORF: He's been aboard all day, sir, checking over medical layout. \\r\\nRIKER: Why a shuttlecraft? Why wouldn't he just beam over? \\r\\nWORF: I suppose he could, sir, but the Admiral's a rather remarkable\\r\\nman.\\r\\n\\n[Corridor]\\n\\n(A very old man in a cardigan is shuffling along.\\r\\nHe is played by DeForrest Kelley, so of course we name this character\\r\\n-)\\xa0\\r\\nMCCOY: Have you got some reason you want my atoms scattered all over\\r\\nspace, boy?\\xa0\\r\\nDATA: No sir. But at your age, sir, I thought you shouldn't have to put\\r\\nup with the time and trouble of a shuttlecraft. \\r\\nMCCOY: Hold it right there, boy. \\r\\nDATA: Sir? \\r\\nMCCOY: What about my age? \\r\\nDATA: Sorry, sir. If that subject troubles you \\r\\nMCCOY: Troubles me? What's so damned troubling about not having died?\\r\\nHow old do you think I am? \\r\\nDATA: One hundred thirty seven years, Admiral, according to Starfleet\\r\\nrecords. \\r\\nMCCOY: Explain how you remember that so exactly. \\r\\nDATA: I remember every fact I am exposed to, sir. \\r\\nMCCOY: I don't see any points on your ears, boy, but you sound like a\\r\\nVulcan. \\r\\nDATA: No, sir. I'm an android. \\r\\nMCCOY: Almost as bad. \\r\\nDATA: I thought it was generally accepted, sir, that Vulcans are an\\r\\nadvanced and most honourable race. \\r\\nMCCOY: They are, they are. And damned annoying at times. \\r\\nDATA: Yes, sir. \\r\\nMCCOY: Well, this is a new ship, but she's got the right name. Now you\\r\\nremember that, you hear. \\r\\nDATA: I will, sir. \\r\\nMCCOY: You treat her like a lady, and she'll always bring you home.\\r\\n\\n[Bridge]\\n\\nPICARD: Did you signal the Hood, Commander Riker? \\r\\nRIKER: Your exact message. Bon voyage mon ami. \\r\\nPICARD: What was my answer, computer? \\r\\nQ [OC]: You're wasting time, Captain. (appears on viewscreen) Or did\\r\\nyou think I was gone? \\r\\nPICARD: Lieutenant! Do you intend to blast a hole through the viewer?\\r\\nIf the purpose of this is to test humans, your honour, we must proceed\\r\\nin our own way. \\r\\nQ [on viewscreen]: You are dilatory. You have twenty four hours. Any\\r\\nfurther delay and you risk summary judgement against you, Captain. \\r\\nWORF: Sorry, sir \\r\\nRIKER: You reacted fast, Mister Worf. \\r\\nPICARD: But futilely. \\r\\nWORF: I will learn to do better, sir. \\r\\nPICARD: Of course you will. We've a long voyage ahead of us. \\r\\nRIKER: What do we do now, Captain? With them monitoring our every move\\r\\nand every word. \\r\\nPICARD: We do exactly what we would do if this Q never existed. If\\r\\nwe're going to be damned, let's be damned for what we really are.\\r\\n\\nPICARD [OC]: Personal log, stardate 41153.8. Of the twenty four\\r\\nhours Q allotted us to prove ourselves, eleven have now passed without\\r\\nincident. And yet I cannot forget Q's prediction that we will face some\\r\\ncritical test.\\r\\n\\n[Ready room]\\n\\nRIKER: This planet's interior heat provides an\\r\\nabundance of geothermal energy, sir. But it's about all this world does\\r\\noffer. \\r\\nPICARD: And it's your belief that this is what made it possible for\\r\\nthem to construct this base to Starfleet standards? \\r\\nRIKER: Yes sir. We have to assume that they've been trading their\\r\\nsurplus energy for the construction materials used here. According to\\r\\nour ship's scans, many of the materials used are not found on this\\r\\nworld. \\r\\nPICARD: Perhaps it's like those incidents you describe in your report\\r\\nas almost magical attempts to please us. \\r\\nRIKER: Those events did happen, sir. \\r\\nPICARD: None of it suggests anything threatening. If only every life\\r\\nform had as much desire to please. Ready to beam down? I'm looking\\r\\nforward to meeting this Groppler Zorn. \\r\\nRIKER: I have a feeling there's more to it than just pleasing us, sir. \\n[Bridge]\\n\\nPICARD: As if it's something Q is doing to trick\\r\\nus? Over here. I've asked the Counsellor to join us in this meeting.\\r\\nMay I introduce our new First Officer, Commander William Riker.\\r\\nCommander Riker, this is our ship's Counsellor, Deanna Troi. \\r\\nTROI [OC]: Do you remember what I taught you, Imzadi? Can you still\\r\\nsense my thoughts? \\r\\nTROI: A pleasure, Commander. \\r\\nRIKER: Likewise, Counsellor. \\r\\nPICARD: Have the two of you met before? \\r\\nRIKER: We have, sir. \\r\\nPICARD: Excellent. I consider it important for my key officers know\\r\\neach other's abilities. \\r\\n(They step into the turbolift) \\r\\nTROI: We do, sir. We do. \\r\\nTROI [OC]: I, too, would never say goodbye, Imzadi.\",\n",
       " \"[Zorn's office]\\n\\nPICARD: My crew and I need a bit more information\\r\\nbefore we make our recommendations to Starfleet. \\r\\nZORN: No objections to that, but but I'm puzzled over you bringing a\\r\\nBetazoid to this. If her purpose, sir, is to probe my thoughts \\r\\nTROI: I can sense only strong emotions, Groppler. I am only half\\r\\nBetazoid. My father was a Starfleet officer. \\r\\nZORN: Well, I have nothing to hide, of course. \\r\\nPICARD: Good, since we admire what we've seen of your construction\\r\\ntechniques. Starfleet may be interested in your constructing starbases\\r\\nelsewhere also. \\r\\nZORN: We are not interested in building other facilities. \\r\\nRIKER: If I may, Captain. Then a trade, Groppler? Some things you need\\r\\nin return for lending us architects and engineers\\r\\nwho can demonstrate your techniques. \\r\\nZORN: Bandi do not enjoy leaving their home world. If Starfleet cannot\\r\\naccept that small weakness, then we will be forced, unhappily, to seek\\r\\nan alliance with someone like the Ferengi, or \\r\\n(Troi gasps) \\r\\nPICARD: Counsellor? What is it? \\r\\nTROI: Do you want it described here, sir? \\r\\nPICARD: Yes. No secrets here if we're to be all to be friends. Agreed,\\r\\nGroppler? \\r\\nZORN: We ourselves have nothing to hide, of course. \\r\\nTROI: Pain. Pain. Loneliness. Terrible loneliness. Despair. I'm not\\r\\nsensing the Groppler, sir, or any of his people, but it's\\r\\nsomething very close to us here. \\r\\nPICARD: The source of this, Groppler. Do you have any idea? \\r\\nZORN: No. No, absolutely not. And I find nothing helpful or productive\\r\\nin any of this! \\r\\nPICARD: And that's it? No other comment? \\r\\nZORN: Well what do you expect of us? We offer you a base designed to\\r\\nyour needs, luxurious even by human standards \\r\\nPICARD: While evading even our simplest questions about it. We'll\\r\\nadjourn for now while we all reconsider our positions. \\r\\nZORN: Captain, the Ferengi would be very interested in a base like\\r\\nthis. \\r\\nPICARD: Fine. I hope they find you as tasty as they did their past\\r\\nassociates.\\r\\n\\n[Corridor]\\n\\nRIKER: Ensign, can you help me find Commander Data?\\r\\nI understand he's somewhere on this deck. \\r\\nENSIGN: This way, sir. You must be new to these Galaxy class starships,\\r\\nsir. (to wall) Tell me the location of Commander Data. \\r\\nCOMPUTER: Lieutenant Commander Data now located in Holodeck area 4J. \\r\\nENSIGN: And as you see, sir, it's pointing you that way. \\r\\nRIKER: Thank you \\r\\nENSIGN: You're welcome, sir. \\r\\n(She appreciates the sight as he walks away) \\r\\nCOMPUTER: The next hatchway on your right. \\r\\nRIKER: Thank you. \\r\\nCOMPUTER: You're welcome, Commander Riker. And if you care to enter,\\r\\nCommander? \\r\\nRIKER: I do. \\r\\n(The holodeck doors open to show trees and vegetation. There is\\r\\nbirdsong)\\r\\n\\n[Forest]\\n\\nRIKER: Hello? \\r\\n(He crosses a stream by stepping stones. One wobbles. Someone is trying\\r\\nto whistle 'Pop goes the Weasel'. Riker finishes the tune) \\r\\nDATA: Marvellous. How easily humans do that. I still need much\\r\\npractice. \\r\\nRIKER: There are some puzzles down on the planet that the Captain wants\\r\\nanswered. He suggests that I take you with me on the away team that\\r\\nI'll be leading. \\r\\nDATA: I shall endeavour to function adequately, sir. \\r\\nRIKER: Yes. When the captain suggested you, I looked up your record. \\r\\nDATA: Yes, sir. A wise procedure, sir, always. \\r\\nRIKER: Then your rank of Lieutenant Commander is honorary? \\r\\nDATA: No, sir. Starfleet class of '78. Honours in probability mechanics\\r\\nand exobiology. \\r\\nRIKER: Your file says that you're an \\r\\nDATA: Machine, Correct, sir. Does that trouble you? \\r\\nRIKER: To be honest, yes, a little. \\r\\nDATA: Understood, sir. Prejudice is very human. \\r\\nRIKER: Now that does trouble me. Do you consider yourself superior to\\r\\nus? \\r\\nDATA: I am superior, sir, in many ways, but I would gladly give it up\\r\\nto be human. \\r\\nRIKER: Nice to meet you, Pinocchio. A joke. \\r\\nDATA: Ah. Intriguing. \\r\\nRIKER: You're going to be an interesting companion, Mister Data. \\r\\nDATA: This woodland pattern is quite popular, sir. Perhaps because it\\r\\nduplicates Earth so well. Coming here almost makes me feel human\\r\\nmyself. \\r\\nRIKER: I didn't believe these simulations could be this real. \\r\\nDATA: Much of it is real, sir. If the transporters can convert our\\r\\nbodies to an energy beam, then back to the original pattern again \\r\\nRIKER: Yes, of course. And these rocks and vegetation have much simpler\\r\\npatterns. \\r\\nDATA: Correct, sir. The rear wall. \\r\\nRIKER: I can't see it. \\r\\nDATA: We're right next to it. \\r\\n(He throws a rock at it, and the image pixilates on impact) \\r\\nRIKER: Incredible! \\r\\nWESLEY [OC]: Commander Riker! \\r\\nWESLEY: (at the stream) Commander Riker, isn't this great? This is one\\r\\nof the simpler patterns. They've got thousands more. Some you just\\r\\ncan't believe. \\r\\nRIKER: Careful, the next rock is loose! \\r\\n(Wesley falls in the water) \\r\\nRIKER: Wesley! \\r\\n(Data rushes down and hauls the boy out with one hand) \\r\\nWESLEY: Wow! \\n[Corridor]\\n\\nRIKER: Mister Data has agreed to join me on the\\r\\naway team, Captain. \\r\\nPICARD: Very good, Commander. \\r\\nWESLEY: Sir, maybe I should get something to wipe this water up. \\r\\nPICARD: Good idea.\\r\\n\\n[Sickbay]\\n\\nWESLEY: There's a low gravity gymnasium, too. It'd\\r\\nbe hard to get bored on this ship. \\r\\nCRUSHER: Good. \\r\\nWESLEY: Mom, could you get me a look at the Bridge? \\r\\nCRUSHER: That's against the Captain's standing orders. \\r\\nWESLEY: Are you afraid of the Captain too? \\r\\nCRUSHER: I certainly am not. \\r\\nWESLEY: But Captain Picard is a pain, isn't he? \\r\\nCRUSHER: Your father liked him very much. Great explorers are often\\r\\nlonely. No chance to have a family. \\r\\nWESLEY: Just a look, at the Bridge. I'll stay in the turbolift when the\\r\\ndoors open. I won't get off. \\r\\nCRUSHER: You are asking for trouble, Wes. We'll see what we can do.\\r\\n\\n[Market place]\\n\\nTASHA: Recommend that someone could begin by\\r\\nexamining the underside of the station, sir. \\r\\nTROI: Our sensors do show some passages, sir. Perhaps you and I? \\r\\nRIKER: Tasha, you and the Counsellor. And, Geordi, I want your eyes\\r\\ndown there. (to Data) You and I will start with topside. \\r\\n(As the three explore underground) \\r\\nRIKER: Have you noticed anything unusual? \\r\\nDATA: I can't see as well as Geordi, sir, but so far the material seems\\r\\nrather very ordinary. \\r\\nRIKER: Construction records? \\r\\nDATA: Construction records show this to be almost identical to that\\r\\nwhich Starfleet uses. \\r\\nTASHA [OC]: Team Leader. \\n[Passageway]\\n\\nTASHA: We've found something interesting. We're in\\r\\na passageway directly under the station, sir. \\r\\nLAFORGE: But these tunnel walls are something I've never seen before,\\r\\nsir. \\n[Marketplace]\\n\\nRIKER: How are you examining them? \\r\\nLAFORGE [OC]: In every way. \\n[Passageway]\\n\\nLAFORGE: Microscopically, thermally,\\r\\nelectromagnetically. None of it is familiar.\\xa0\\r\\nRIKER [OC]: What about you, Troi? \\r\\nTROI: Sir, I've avoided opening my mind. Whatever I felt in the\\r\\nGroppler's office became very uncomfortable. \\n[Marketplace]\\n\\nRIKER: I'm sorry, Counsellor, but you must. We need\\r\\nmore information. \\n[Passageway]\\n\\nTROI: Pain. Such pain! Pain! \\n[Marketplace]\\n\\nRIKER: Hang on, I'm coming. Enterprise, lock us\\r\\nonto her signal. \\n[Passageway]\\n\\n(Data and Riker beam into the passageway) \\r\\nRIKER: I'm sorry. Close your mind to the pain. \\r\\nTROI: Unhappiness. Terrible despair. \\r\\nRIKER: Who? \\r\\nTROI: I don't know. No life form anything like us. \\r\\nRIKER: What in the hell kind of place is this? Geordi, what do you see?\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFORGE: Well, it's of no material I recognise, sir, or have even heard\\r\\nof. \\r\\n(They carry on exploring) \\n[Bridge]\\n\\n(The turbolift doors open, and Wesley is standing\\r\\nthere) \\r\\nPICARD: Children are not allowed on the Bridge. \\r\\n(Crusher appears from where she was hiding) \\r\\nCRUSHER: Permission to report to the captain \\r\\nPICARD: Doctor Crusher. \\r\\nCRUSHER: Captain. Sir, my son is not on the Bridge. He merely\\r\\naccompanied me on the turbolift. \\r\\nPICARD: Your son? \\r\\nCRUSHER: His name's Wesley. You last saw him years ago when \\r\\nPICARD: Well, as long as he's here. I knew your father, Wesley. Want a\\r\\nlook around? \\r\\n(Wesley steps onto the Bridge) \\r\\nPICARD: But don't touch anything! Try it out. (the captain's chair) The\\r\\npanel on your right is for log entries, library computer access and\\r\\nretrieval, viewscreen control, intercoms, and so on. Here we have \\r\\nWESLEY: And here, the backup conn and ops panels, plus shield and\\r\\narmoury controls. \\r\\nPICARD: The forward viewscreen is controlled from the ops position\\r\\nthere \\r\\nWESLEY: Which uses high resolution, multi-spectral imaging sensor\\r\\nsystems \\r\\nPICARD: How the hell do you know that, boy? \\r\\nWESLEY: Perimeter alert, Captain! \\r\\nCRUSHER: Wesley! \\r\\nWESLEY: I'm sorry. \\r\\nCRUSHER: You shouldn't have touched anything \\r\\nPICARD: Off the bridge! Both of you. \\r\\nWORF: You have a perimeter alert, sir. \\r\\nCRUSHER: As my son tried to tell you! \\r\\n(Crusher and Wesley step back into the turbolift) \\r\\nPICARD: Picard. Go ahead. \\r\\nSECURITY [OC]: Ship's sensors have detected the presence of a vessel\\r\\napproaching this planet. No ship is scheduled to arrive at this time,\\r\\nsir. \\r\\nPICARD: Have Commander Riker and his team beam back up. Security, could\\r\\nthat be the Hood returning here? \\r\\nSECURITY [OC]: The vessel does not match the Hood's configuration or ID\\r\\nsignal. \\r\\nPICARD: Put it on main viewer. Identification? \\r\\nWORF: Vessel unknown, configuration unknown, sir. \\r\\n(It looks like a classic flying saucer) \\r\\nPICARD: Hail it. \\r\\nWORF: We've been trying, sir. No response. \\r\\nPICARD: Raise all shields, phasers at ready. \\r\\nWORF: Shields up, sir. Phasers ready. \\r\\nPICARD: Get me Groppler Zorn. And continue universal greetings on all\\r\\nfrequencies. \\r\\nZORN [OC]: This is Zorn, Captain. \\r\\nPICARD: Zorn, an unidentified vessel has entered into orbit with us. \\n[Zorn's office]\\n\\nPICARD [OC]: Do you know who it is? \\r\\nZORN: There are no ships scheduled to arrive until \\n[Bridge]\\n\\nPICARD: I asked if you knew who it is. You\\r\\nmentioned the Ferengi Alliance to me. \\n[Zorn's office]\\n\\nZORN: But we have had no dealings with them. It was\\r\\nonly a, a thought. \\n[Bridge]\\n\\nPICARD: Are you certain? \\r\\nZORN [OC]: I promise you, Captain. \\n[Zorn's office]\\n\\nZORN: We were making an empty threat. I wanted your\\r\\ncooperation. Forgive me. \\n[Bridge]\\n\\nWORF: Definitely entering orbital trajectory, sir. \\r\\nSECURITY: (at Tasha's station) It measures twelve times our volume,\\r\\nCaptain. \\r\\n(A purple light envelopes the Enterprise) \\r\\nWORF: Sensors say we were just scanned, sir.\\r\\n\\n[Passageway]\\n\\nTASHA: Pain again? \\r\\nRIKER: Troi, you've been at it enough. \\r\\nTROI: No, I feel close to an answer of some kind. \\r\\nDATA: Commander, something down here is shielding our communicators. \\r\\nTROI: Yes, that's exactly the feeling I've been reading. As if someone\\r\\ndoesn't want us to be in touch with our ship. \\r\\nRIKER: Come on, let's get to the surface.\\r\\n\\n[Bridge]\\n\\nWORF: There is no computer record of any such\\r\\nvessel, sir. Nothing even close. \\r\\nSECURITY: Still no response, sir. We've done everything but threaten\\r\\nthem. \\r\\nPICARD: Sensor scans, Mister Worf. \\r\\nWORF: Our sensor signals seem to just bounce off. Something's\\r\\nhappening, sir. They're firing on Farpoint, sir! \\r\\nPICARD: Bring photon torpedoes to ready! \\r\\nWORF: Wait, sir. They're hitting the old Bandi city, not Farpoint\\r\\nStation. \\r\\n(The ruined and empty city is being smashed by purple blasts) \\n[Passageway]\\n\\n(The away team can hear the blasts) \\r\\nTROI: Those stairs are where we entered down here, sir. \\r\\nLAFORGE: At this point, it becomes ordinary stone, sir. Matching what's\\r\\nabove. \\r\\nTASHA: My God! Was that a phaser blast? \\r\\nDATA: Negative. But something similar. \\r\\nRIKER: You, Tasha, and Geordi will beam up to the ship. Now, come on, I\\r\\nwant to see exactly what's happening. \\r\\nTROI: Don't. If you should be hurt \\r\\nRIKER: You have your orders, Lieutenant. Carry them out. \\r\\nTROI: Yes sir, I'm sorry, sir. Enterprise, three to beam up. \\n[Zorn's office]\\n\\nZORN: Enterprise, Enterprise, come in! Help us,\\r\\nplease! What shall we do? \\n[Bridge]\\n\\nZORN [OC]: Enterprise, help us, please! \\r\\nPICARD: Tune that down! Commander Riker, come in. Can you hear me? \\n[Bandi city]\\n\\n(Data and Riker phaser open a door and rush\\r\\nthrough) \\r\\nRIKER: Riker to Enterprise, come in. \\r\\nPICARD [OC]: Commander Riker, come in. Where are you? \\r\\nRIKER: With Data, on the edge of the old city, sir. It's being hit\\r\\nhard, sir. \\n[Bridge]\\n\\nPICARD: And Farpoint Station? Any damage there? \\r\\nRIKER [OC]: Negative on damage to Farpoint, sir. Whoever they are, it\\r\\nseems they're carefully avoiding hitting the station. \\r\\nPICARD: It's from an unidentified vessel that's entered into orbit with\\r\\nus here. \\n[Bandi city]\\n\\nPICARD [OC]: No ID, no answer to our signals. \\r\\nRIKER: The old Bandi city's being hit hard, sir. Many casualties very\\r\\nprobable. \\r\\nPICARD [OC]: Understand, Commander. \\n[Bridge]\\n\\nPICARD: Would you object to your Captain ordering a\\r\\nclearly illegal kidnapping? \\n[Bandi city]\\n\\nRIKER: No objection, sir. \\n[Bridge]\\n\\nPICARD: Groppler Zorn may have the answers we need.\\r\\nGet him. Bring him here. \\n[Bandi city]\\n\\nRIKER: Aye, sir. \\n[Bridge]\\n\\nPICARD: They're forcing a difficult decision on me,\\r\\nCounsellor. \\r\\nTROI: But I doubt protecting the Bandi would violate the Prime\\r\\nDirective. True, they are not actual allies, but \\r\\nPICARD: We are in the midst of diplomatic discussions with them.\\r\\nLieutenant, lock phasers on that vessel. \\r\\nTASHA: Phasers locked on, Captain. \\r\\n(There's a flash, and the Judge Q stands there) \\r\\nQ: Typical. So typical. Savage lifeforms never follow even their own\\r\\nrules. \\r\\nPICARD: Get off my bridge! \\r\\nQ: Interesting, that order about phasers. \\r\\nTASHA: Standing by on phasers, Captain. \\r\\nQ: Please, don't let me interfere. Use your weapons. \\r\\nPICARD: We've no idea who is on that vessel. My order was a routine\\r\\nsafety precaution. \\r\\nQ: Really? No idea of what it represents? The meaning of that vessel is\\r\\nas plain, as plain as the noses on your ugly little primate faces. And\\r\\nif you were truly civilised, Captain, wouldn't you be doing something\\r\\nabout the casualties happening down there? \\r\\nPICARD: Captain to CMO. \\n[Sickbay]\\n\\nPICARD [OC]: Are you reading any of this? \\r\\nCRUSHER: Medical teams already preparing to beam down, Captain. \\n[Bridge]\\n\\nPICARD: Compliments on that, Doctor. Any questions?\\r\\nStarfleet people are trained to render aid and assistance whenever \\r\\nQ: But not trained in clear thinking. \\r\\nPICARD: Let's consider your thoughts. You call us savages and yet you\\r\\nknew those people down there would be killed. It is your conduct that\\r\\nis uncivilised. \\r\\nWORF: Sir, they're firing on the planet again. \\r\\nPICARD: Go to manoeuvring jets. Position us between that vessel and the\\r\\nplanet. Force fields full on. \\r\\nWORF: Aye, sir. Impulse power to (beep) We have no ship control, sir.\\r\\nIt's gone!\\r\\n\\n[Bandi city]\\n\\n(Riker painfully hauls himself up from the ground.\\r\\nHe is covered in dust) \\r\\nDATA: Are you undamaged? \\r\\nRIKER: Yes. You? \\r\\nDATA: All systems operating. \\r\\n(They hear sobbing, and enter - )\\r\\n\\n[Zorn's office]\\n\\n(Zorn is hiding underneath his desk) \\r\\nZORN: Please! Make it stop! You can drive it away! \\r\\nRIKER: Drive who away, Groppler? \\r\\nZORN: I don't know. \\r\\nDATA: Unlikely, sir. Our records show that you supervised all Bandi\\r\\ncontact with other worlds. \\r\\nZORN: We done nothing anything wrong! \\r\\nRIKER: Then if we can learn nothing from you, we'll leave. \\r\\nZORN: No! Oh no, please, don't leave. I'll try to explain. \\r\\n(Then he gets beamed away, screaming)\\r\\nRIKER: First officer to Enterprise. We've lost Zorn. Something like a\\r\\ntransporter beam seems to have snatched him away. \\n[Bridge]\\n\\nRIKER [OC]: Question, sir, could it be this Q? \\r\\nQ: None of you knows who transported him. You're running out of time,\\r\\nCaptain. \\r\\nTROI: Captain, suddenly I'm sensing something else. Satisfaction.\\r\\nEnormous satisfaction. \\r\\nPICARD: From the same source as before? \\r\\nTROI: No, that was on the planet. This is much closer. \\r\\nQ: Excellent, Counsellor. He's such a dullard, isn't he? \\r\\nCREW [OC]: Captain from Transporter Room. First Officer and Mister Data\\r\\nhave beamed aboard. \\r\\nQ: Excellent also. Perhaps with more of these little minds helping \\r\\nPICARD: That is enough, damn it! \\r\\nQ: Have you forgotten that we have an agreement, \\r\\nPICARD: An agreement which you are at this moment breaking by taking\\r\\nover our vessel, interfering with my decisions. Either leave or finish\\r\\nus. \\r\\nQ: Temper, temper, mon Capitaine. I'm merely trying to assist a pitiful\\r\\nspecies. But perhaps I will leave if Commander Riker provides me with\\r\\nsome amusement. \\r\\nPICARD: Do nothing that he asks. \\r\\nQ (JUDGE): But I ask so little, and it's so necessary if you're to\\r\\nsolve all this. Beam over there with your what do you call it? Your\\r\\naway team. \\r\\nPICARD: I'll risk none of my crew on that unknown. \\r\\nQ: You should already know what you'll find there. Or perhaps it's too\\r\\nadult a puzzle for you. \\r\\nRIKER: With all respect, Captain, I want to beam over there. \\r\\nQ: You show promise, my good fellow. \\r\\nRIKER: Have you understood any part of what he's tried to tell you?\\r\\nHumanity is no longer a savage race. \\r\\nQ: But you must still prove that. \\r\\n(And he vanishes) \\r\\nPICARD: At least you impressed him, Number One. That's hopeful. \\r\\nRIKER: Thank you, Captain. Captain, if he's not open to evidence in our\\r\\nfavour, where will you go from there? \\r\\nPICARD: I'll attend to my duty. \\r\\nRIKER: To the bitter end? \\r\\nPICARD: I see nothing so bitter about that. \\n[Crusher's office]\\n\\nCRUSHER: Can I help you, Captain? \\r\\nPICARD: I didn't want you thinking me harsh. Cold blooded. \\r\\nCRUSHER: Why oh why would I ever think that. \\r\\nPICARD: I didn't welcome you aboard personally, professionally. I made\\r\\nyou come to me on the Bridge. I yelled at your son. Who, as you pointed\\r\\nout, was quite correct. He does seem to have a very good grasp of\\r\\nstarship operations. \\r\\nCRUSHER: You've just won this mother's heart, Captain. \\r\\nPICARD: Ah, but, now, your assignment here. I would consider and\\r\\napprove you a transfer for you. \\r\\nCRUSHER: Oh. You consider me unqualified? \\r\\nPICARD: Hardly. Your service record shows you're just the Chief Medical\\r\\nOfficer I want. \\r\\nCRUSHER: Then you must object to me personally. \\r\\nPICARD: I'm trying to be considerate of your feelings, Doctor. For you\\r\\nto work with a commanding officer who would continually remind you of a\\r\\nterrible personal tragedy. \\r\\nCRUSHER: If I had had any objections to serving with you, I wouldn't\\r\\nhave requested this assignment, Captain. \\r\\nPICARD: You requested this posting? \\r\\nCRUSHER: My feelings about my husband's death will have no effect on\\r\\nthe way I serve you, this vessel, or this mission. \\r\\nPICARD: Ah. Then, welcome aboard, Doctor. \\r\\n(They shake hands) \\r\\nRIKER [OC]: Riker to Picard. We're ready to beam over, sir. \\r\\nPICARD: I, er, I hope we can be friends? \\r\\nCRUSHER: Thank you. \\n[Transporter room]\\n\\n(The away team is Data, Tasha, Troi and Riker) \\r\\nRIKER: Phasers on stun. Energise. \\n[Alien vessel]\\n\\n(It looks like the passages under the Bandi city) \\r\\nDATA: Most interesting, sir. \\r\\nTASHA: It's much the same construction we saw in the underground\\r\\ntunnel. \\r\\nDATA: But no sound of power. No equipment. \\r\\nTASHA: How does this ship run? \\r\\nRIKER: What is it, Troi? Is it the same as you felt down there? \\r\\nTROI: No. This is much more powerful. Full of anger! Hate! \\r\\nTASHA: Toward us? \\r\\nTROI: No. It's directed down toward the old Bandi city. \\r\\nDATA: Most intriguing again, sir. The place that this vessel was firing\\r\\nupon was not the Farpoint starbase, but the home of those who\\r\\nconstructed. Sorry, sir. I seem to be commenting on everything. \\r\\nRIKER: Good. Don't stop, my friend.\\r\\n\\n[Bridge]\\n\\nRIKER [OC]: Enterprise, Riker. This is turning out\\r\\nto be a very long tunnel or corridor, sir. \\n[Alien vessel]\\n\\nRIKER: No ship's crew in sight. No sign of\\r\\nmechanism or circuitry. No controls or read-outs. This is nothing like\\r\\nany vessel I've seen before. \\r\\nTROI: Groppler Zorn, sir. A great fear just ahead. \\n[Bridge]\\n\\nTROI [OC]: There's a different feeling here than in\\r\\nthe tunnel. Very different. \\n[Alien vessel]\\n\\nZORN [OC]: No! Please! No more! Please, no more!\\r\\nPlease, please, make it stop! Please! Please! Please! Make it stop!\\r\\nPlease! \\r\\n(They find Zorn suspended in a force field, in pain) \\r\\nZORN: No! Please! No more, please! No more! Please! \\r\\nRIKER: Zorn. Can you hear me? \\r\\nZORN: The pain! No! \\r\\nTROI: Has the alien communicated? \\r\\nZORN: Please! Please! Please, no more! \\r\\nTROI: That's it, sir. It's just one alien that I'm sensing here. \\r\\nZORN: Please! I don't understand what you want! \\r\\nTROI: Not true. He does know. \\r\\nZORN: No, please, no more. No more! No, no, no, don't! \\r\\n(Riker and Data modulate their phasers to disrupt the force field, and\\r\\nZorn drops onto a big soft mattress. The alien ship is not pleased\\r\\nabout this) \\n[Bridge]\\n\\nWORF: Captain! \\r\\nPICARD: Transporter chief, yank them back now! Riker, acknowledge! \\r\\n(Flash! Q is in a Starfleet uniform) \\r\\nQ: Your time is up, Captain. \\r\\nPICARD: Transporter Chief, do you have their coordinates? Transporter\\r\\nChief! \\r\\nQ: He can't hear you, Captain. \\r\\nPICARD: Transporter Chief, come in! I've people in trouble over there,\\r\\nQ. \\r\\n(Q sits himself in the Captain's chair) \\r\\nPICARD: Everyone at ease. That's an order. Q, my people are in trouble.\\r\\nLet me help them, please. I'll do whatever you say. \\r\\n(The away team and Zorn materialise on the Bridge) \\r\\nQ: You'll do whatever I say? \\r\\nPICARD: It seems I did make that bargain. \\r\\nTROI: The agreement isn't valid, sir. It wasn't Q that saved us. \\r\\nQ: Save yourself. It may attack you now. \\r\\nRIKER: It was that which sent us back, Captain. \\r\\nTROI: Yes sir. It is not merely a vessel, sir. Somehow it is alive. \\r\\nQ: She lies. Destroy it while you have a chance. Make phasers and\\r\\nphoton torpedoes ready. \\r\\nPICARD: No! Do nothing he demands. \\r\\nZORN: Captain, that thing was killing my people! \\r\\nPICARD: Was there a reason? \\r\\nQ: It is an unknown, Captain. Isn't that enough? \\r\\nPICARD: If you'd earned that uniform you're wearing, you'd know that\\r\\nthe unknown is what brings us out here. \\r\\nQ: Wasted effort, considering the human intelligence. \\r\\nPICARD: Let's test that. Beginning with the tunnels you have under\\r\\nFarpoint, Groppler. \\r\\nRIKER: Identical to the ones on the space vessel lifeform over there.\\r\\nWhy was it punishing you, Groppler? \\r\\nPICARD: In return for some pain you'd given other creature? \\r\\nZORN: We've done nothing wrong. It was injured. We helped it. \\r\\nPICARD: Thank you. That was the missing part. Lieutenant Yar, rig main\\r\\nphaser banks to deliver an energy beam. \\r\\nTASHA: Aye, sir. \\r\\nRIKER: You're right, Captain. It has to be conceivable that somewhere\\r\\nin this galaxy there could exist creatures able to convert energy into\\r\\nmatter. \\r\\nPICARD: And into specific patterns of matter, just as our transporters\\r\\ndo. \\r\\nTASHA: On the viewer, Captain! \\r\\n(The alien vessel transforms into a giant space jellyfish) \\r\\nPICARD: Groppler, you captured something like that, didn't you? \\r\\nZORN: Warn my people, please, to leave Farpoint Station immediately! \\r\\nQ: He lies, Captain. Shouldn't you let his people die? \\r\\nPICARD: Transmit the message, leave Farpoint Space Station immediately.\\r\\n\\r\\nTROI: Then it was a pair of creatures I was sensing. One down there in\\r\\ngrief and pain, the other up here, filled with anger. \\r\\nDATA: And firing not on the new space station, but on the Bandi and\\r\\ntheir city. \\r\\nPICARD: Attacking those who had captured, capture its mate. \\r\\nTASHA: Energy beam ready, sir. \\r\\nPICARD: Lock it in on Farpoint Station. \\r\\nQ: I see now it was too simple a puzzle. Generosity has always been my\\r\\nweakness. \\r\\nPICARD: Let it have whatever it can absorb. Energise. \\r\\n(A stream of light bathes Farpoint) \\r\\nTASHA: Now getting feedback on the beam, sir. \\r\\nPICARD: Discontinue. Groppler Zorn, there'll soon be no Farpoint\\r\\nStation, if I'm right about this. \\r\\nQ: A lucky guess. \\r\\n(Farpoint transforms into another space jellyfish) \\r\\nZORN: Please believe me, we meant no harm to the creature. It was\\r\\nstarving for energy. \\r\\nPICARD: Which your world furnishes you in plenty. \\r\\nZORN: We did feed it. \\r\\nPICARD: Only enough to keep it alive, so that you could force it to\\r\\nshape itself into whatever form you needed! \\r\\n(The second jellyfish takes off, and the two touch tendrils, lovingly,\\r\\nbefore leaving) \\r\\nTROI: Sir! Wonderful! A feeling of great joy. And gratitude. Great joy\\r\\nand gratitude, from both of them. \\r\\nPICARD: Why do you use other lifeforms for recreation? \\r\\nQ: If so, you've not provided the best. \\r\\nPICARD: Leave us! We've passed your little test. \\r\\nQ: Temper, temper, mon Capitaine. \\r\\nPICARD: Get off my ship. \\r\\nQ: I do so only because it suits me to. But I will not promise never to\\r\\nappear again. \\nCaptain's log, stardate 41174.2. The agreement for\\r\\nthe rebuilding Farpoint Station has been completed per my instructions.\\r\\n\\n[Bridge]\\n\\nPICARD: All stations? \\r\\nDATA: Ready for departure, sir. \\r\\nPICARD: Some problem, Riker? \\r\\nRIKER: Just hoping this isn't the usual way our missions will go, sir. \\r\\nPICARD: Oh no, Number One. I'm sure most will be much more interesting.\\r\\nLet's see what's out there. Engage. \",\n",
